# Onitama AlphaZero

An implementation of AlphaZero for the game [Onitama].

Minimal amount of dependencies. I wrote almost everything from scratch including
the tensor library. I did this is as a learning exercise to learn more about
machine learning and the math behind it. The code is far from perfect and it is
not intended to be used as a replacement for well tested libraries like
TensorFlow or PyTorch

I was inspired by this great [blog post] by Surag Nair. In one of my friend
groups we make bots for various games, and for Onitama we made a [server] and a
[website] (with an API for bots). I wanted to try something different and this
is the result.

Here is a link to the original [AlphaZero] paper by Deepmind.
